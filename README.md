Project Assignments – Human–Computer Interaction

Two projects are developed in the following environments: Bootstrap and WordPress.

The task is to create a shopping mall website.

The website must contain a minimum of 6 pages, each with a different structure and purpose, aligned with the project theme.

The website must include the following pages:

Home page – must include (among other content) a carousel component and news

Shopping mall stores

Gallery

Gift card ordering

Contact

Survey (poll)

The project must be created using the material covered in lectures and lab sessions. All pages must include a header, body, and footer.

Additional requirements for the Bootstrap project

Using the SASS preprocessor, implement a theme creation feature that is applied to the navigation menu and the survey (e.g., by defining parameters for colors, sizes, etc.).

Using the jQuery library, create a survey with at least three questions. Answers must be selected from a dropdown list with ratings from 1 to 5. Display statistics per question.

If the rating is between 1 and 2.5, mark the statistics in red.

If the rating is between 2.5 and 3.5, mark the statistics in yellow/orange.

If the rating is greater than 3.5, mark the statistics in green.
